SnakEscape Open Beta
==============

This is the README for the WebGL and PC version of SnakEscape. The Mobile version of SnakEscape has a different repo at SnakEscape.

Please use this repository to report bugs for SnakEscape.

The language used for this tracker is English. If this is a challenge, please consider using an online translator to convert your post into English. This does not extend to system information, but rather, only to actual report text.

Conduct
-------

There are basic rules of conduct that should be followed at all times by everyone participating in the discussions. While this is generally a relaxed environment, please remember the following:

- Do not insult, harass, or demean anyone.
- Do not intentionally multi-post an issue.
- Do not use ALL CAPS when creating an issue report.
- Do not repeatedly update an open issue remarking that the issue persists.

Remember: Just because the issue you reported was reported here does not mean that it is an issue with SnakEscape. As well, should your issue not be resolved immediately, it does not mean that a resolution is not being researched or tested. Patience is always appreciated.

Reporting Issues
----------------

If you encounter a bug while testing open beta version of SnakEscape, first search the [issue list](https://github.com/SnakEscape/OpenBeta/issues) to see if it has already been reported. Include closed issues in your search.

If it has not been reported, create a new issue with at least the following information:

- what platform this is occuring on: Linux/Mac/PC;
- what browser do you use for beta testing: Chrome, IE, Edge, FireFox, Opera or etc.;
- a short, descriptive title;
- a detailed description of the issue, including any output from the command line;
- steps for reproducing the issue; and
- your [system information](#system-information).

Please place logs either in a code block (press `M` in your browser for a GFM cheat sheet) or a [gist](https://gist.github.com).

### System information

Your system information must include:
- your Linux distro/Mac OS version/Windows version
- if Linux, your Desktop/Window Manager
- if Mac, the model and revision of your hardware
- your Graphics card info (manufacturer, card version), any and all graphics driver versions
- anything else that you think may be useful (mouse/keyboard, filesystem type, etc).

The preferred and easiest way to get this information is from Steam's Hardware Information viewer from the menu (`Help -> System Information`).

Once your information appears: right-click within the dialog, choose `Select All`, right-click again, and then choose `Copy`.
Paste this information into your report, preferably in a code block or a [gist](https://gist.github.com).
